ðŸŒŸ Announcing the Tahopen Project: An Open Source Alternative for the Pentaho Community! ðŸŒŸ

Dear Pentaho Community,

We are excited to introduce the Tahopen Project, a fork of Pentaho version 10.1! As Pentaho transitions to a Business Source License with version 10.3, we recognize the need for an open and accessible alternative. Tahopen aims to keep the spirit of open-source alive, providing a platform for collaboration and innovation.

We invite all members of the Pentaho community to join us in this exciting endeavor. Your contributions, whether through code, ideas, or feedback, will be invaluable as we build a project that serves everyone.

If you're interested in collaborating, please visit our GitHub repository: GitHub - Tahopen Project. Together, we can ensure that the benefits of Pentaho's capabilities remain accessible to all.

Thank you for your support, and letâ€™s create something amazing together!

Best regards,
The Tahopen Team
Marcio Junior Vieira - Team Leader 


**Tahopen Manifesto: The Open Future of Business Analytics**

Open source software has been the foundation of innovation and collaboration for communities worldwide. It empowers developers, businesses, and governments to work together transparently to build robust, accessible solutions. When a product closes its license or limits access, it is not the end. Instead, it signals the birth of new possibilities. Tahopen emerges from this belief.

1. The Power of the Fork
Whenever a closed-source project seeks to restrict its users' freedom, the open source community responds with innovation. Tahopen is a fork of Pentaho, a once open-source business analytics platform that served as a benchmark. Now, with a renewed focus on openness and collaboration, Tahopen taps into the continuing potential of a truly open ecosystem. A fork is not the end of a cycle but the rebirth of a collaborative vision.

2. Freedom and Transparency
At the heart of open source software lies freedom of choice and transparency. Tahopen ensures that all usersâ€”whether individuals, organizations, or governmentsâ€”have full access to its features without restrictions or hidden costs. This is essential for trust and the creation of long-term solutions. Tahopen is built on a foundation of Open Source and Free Software, embracing both the freedom of modification and the guarantee that the software will always remain accessible to its users.

3. A Core Powered by Open Source and Free Software
Tahopen leverages the power of both Open Source and Free Software at its core, integrating the best of these philosophies into a unified platform. By building on established open technologies, Tahopen ensures that innovation is not only shared but also continuously improved by a community that values transparency and collaboration. This blend of Open Source and Free Software offers a solid, secure, and flexible foundation for business analytics solutions, without the fear of vendor lock-in or closed features.

4. Community First
The success of any open source project depends on its community. Tahopen will be guided by open collaboration and continuous feedback. We invite everyone to participate, whether by contributing code, documentation, bug reports, or discussions. Tahopen is built by the community and for the community. By empowering users to become contributors, Tahopen creates an environment where everyone can shape the future of the platform.

5. Continuous Innovation
While commercial products often focus on restrictions and intellectual property control, open source thrives on shared innovation. Tahopen will continue to evolve, integrating new technologies, optimizing performance, and expanding capabilities according to community demand. There will be no limitations imposed by commercial interests, only the continuous desire to improve. The blend of Open Source and Free Software ensures that every innovation is shared, benefiting the entire ecosystem without barriers.

6. When One Product Closes, Another is Born
Open source software shows us that innovation cannot be contained. Every time a company decides to close its code, new doors open for the community. Tahopen is a prime example: the natural response to a product going closed-source is the birth of a free alternative that adheres to open source principles and provides an accessible platform for all.

Tahopen is not just a tool; itâ€™s a philosophy. It embodies the belief that technology should be open, accessible, and evolve through collaboration. By embracing both Open Source and Free Software, Tahopen ensures that innovation is always shared, freedom is respected, and the power of analytics is available to all. Join us on this journey of freedom and innovation, where every contribution strengthens the ecosystem and keeps the spirit of open source alive.

This enhanced manifesto emphasizes the foundational role that Open Source and Free Software play in Tahopen, ensuring a truly open and accessible platform that benefits from shared innovation and community-driven development.
