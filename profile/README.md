ðŸŒŸ Announcing the Tahopen Project: An Open Source Alternative for the Pentaho Community! ðŸŒŸ

Dear Pentaho Community,

We are excited to introduce the Tahopen Project, a fork of Pentaho version 10.1! As Pentaho transitions to a Business Source License with version 10.3, we recognize the need for an open and accessible alternative. Tahopen aims to keep the spirit of open-source alive, providing a platform for collaboration and innovation.

We invite all members of the Pentaho community to join us in this exciting endeavor. Your contributions, whether through code, ideas, or feedback, will be invaluable as we build a project that serves everyone.

If you're interested in collaborating, please visit our GitHub repository: GitHub - Tahopen Project. Together, we can ensure that the benefits of Pentaho's capabilities remain accessible to all.


If you align with the principles of Tahopen and would like to support or contribute in any way, we invite you to sign the manifesto by submitting a pull request on GitHub. Add your name or organization under the appropriate category (Companies, Projects, Foundations, or Individuals) and specify how you plan to contribute or support the project.

Best regards,
The Tahopen Team
Marcio Junior Vieira - Team Leader
